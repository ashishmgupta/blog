            Turns out some elves have gone on some misdirected journeys around the globe. <br>
            It seems that someone is messing with their travel plans.<br>
            We could sure use your open-source intelligence (OSINT) skills to find them.<br>
            Why dontcha' log into this vintage Cranberry Pi terminal and see if you have what it takes to track them around the globe.<br>
            If you're having any trouble with it, <b>you might ask Piney Sappington right over there for tips</b>.<br>
        </td>
        </tr>
</table>
Tangle Coalbox indicates another elf named ‚ÄúPiney Sappington‚Äù may have some hints on how to solve this objective. <br>
So, we head over to that elf now who is also present in the courtyard.

<table>
        <tr>
        <td><img src="images/hhc2021/image013.png" alt="drawing" width="200px"/></td>
        <td>
            <b>Hints from Piney Sappington</b><br>
            You see, I've been looking at these documents, and I know someone has tampered with one file. <br>
            Do you think you could log into this Cranberry Pi and take a look?<br>
            It has exiftool installed on it, if that helps you at all.<br>
            I just... Well, I have a feeling that someone at that other conference might have fiddled with things.<br>
            And, if you help me figure this tampering issue out, I‚Äôll give you some hints about OSINT, especially associated with geographic locations!<br>
        </td>
        </tr>
</table>

In the terminal we are presented with the below problem:<br>
>HELP! That wily jack Frost Modified one of our naughty/nice records, and right before Christmas! 
>Can you help us which one? We‚Äôve installed exiftool for your convenience!

<img src="images/hhc2021/image014.png" alt="drawing" width="500px"/>

We will get the Last Modified By attribute value for all the docx files and then grep the output it with ‚ÄúJack‚Äù. <br>
That should give us all the files which were last modified by Jack Frost. <br> 
We have -C 5 in the grep so we can get the lines around the matches for the context.

Hint Unlocked :<br>
<img src="images/hhc2021/image018.png" alt="drawing" width="500px"/>


The ‚Äúflask cookies‚Äù hint is actually a Github Gist from Mr. Chris Elgee. <br>
[https://gist.github.com/chriselgee/b9f1861dd9b99a8c1ed30066b25ff80b](https://gist.github.com/chriselgee/b9f1861dd9b99a8c1ed30066b25ff80b) <br>
That above gist shows how one can decode the value in a cookie generated by Flask applications. <br>

Going back to objective #2 we start the game.<br>
<img src="images/hhc2021/caramel_santaigo_start_game.png" alt="drawing" width="500px"/><br>
In the browser we open developer tools. <br>
Under developer tools > Application tab there is a cookie named "Cookiepella" for the domain used for the challenge (caramel.kringlecastle.com).<br>

<img src="images/hhc2021/image019.png" alt="drawing" width="1000px"/> <br>

We follow the instructions to decode the value in the flask cookie to JSON.<br>

```python
cookie = "<value of the cookiepella cookie>"
import zlib; import itsdangerous
zlib.decompress(itsdangerous.base64_decode(cookie))
```
<img src="images/hhc2021/image020.png" alt="drawing" width="1000px"/> <br>

We format the output JSON for better understanding.<br>
The JSON has details about the elf to identify them. <br>
The JSON has also has the route the elf took. We can take the same route to catch the elf. <br>
<img src="images/hhc2021/image021.png" alt="drawing" width="800px"/> <br>

On the visit interlink page, we supply data we have in the decoded flask cookie and click on "Filter Elves". <br>
<img src="images/hhc2021/image022.png" alt="drawing" width="1000px"/> <br>

The elves have been filtered out based on the data and possibly Its Morcel Nougat and their location was "Santa's Castel"<br>
Both of these datapoints are also in the decoded cookie value.<br>

Note the route taken by the elf in the decoded cookie value:<br>
<b>Stuttgart, Germany > Tokyo, Japan > London, England > PlaceHolder</b><br>
We click on "Depart by sleigh" to follow the same route to catch up with the elf in London, England.<br>

<table>
        <tr>
            <td>In London, England, we notice there is no option to "Depart by Sleigh"<br>
                which indicates we are close to the elf. We click on Investigate.
            </td>
            <td>
            We are presented with 3 investigate options.<br>
            </td>
        <tr>
        <td>
        <img src="images/hhc2021/image023.png" alt="drawing" width="500px"/>
        </td>
        <td>
            <img src="images/hhc2021/image024.png" alt="drawing" width="500px"/><br>
        </td>
        </tr>
</table>


When we click on "Investigate 1", It says we have caught up to the elf.<br>
We are given the option to guess the elf.<br>
We choose "Morcel Nouget" since Its also in the name of the elf in the decoded cookie.
<img src="images/hhc2021/image025.png" alt="drawing" width="1000px"/> <br>

Upon selecting the elf and clicking on the ‚ÄúGuess Elf‚Äù <br>
The message "You've won" appears which means we have completed the challenge.<br>

    Yo, I'm Grimy McTrollkins. <br>
    I'm a troll and I work for the big guy over there: Jack Frost.<br>
    I‚Äôd rather not be bothered talking with you, but I‚Äôm kind of in a bind and need your help.<br>
    Jack Frost is so obsessed with icy cold that he accidentally froze shut the door to Frost Tower!<br>
    I wonder if you can help me get back in.<br>
    I think we can melt the door open if we can just get access to the thermostat inside the building.<br>
    That thermostat uses Wi-Fi. And I‚Äôll bet you picked up a Wi-Fi adapter for your badge when you got to the North Pole.<br>
    Click on your badge and go to the Items tab. There, you should see your Wi-Fi Dongle and a button to ‚ÄúOpen Wi-Fi CLI.‚Äù That‚Äôll give you<br> command-line interface access to your badge‚Äôs wireless capabilities.<br>

Scan for any available the ESSIDs  <br>
```bash
iwlist wlan0 scanning 
```

<img src="images/hhc2021/image031.png" alt="drawing" width="600px"/>

We find an ESSID named ‚ÄúFROST-Nidus-Setup‚Äù. <br>
Now we connect to ‚ÄúFROST-Nidus-Setup‚Äù ESSID.
```bash
iwconfig wlan0 essid FROST-Nidus-Setup

    He asked me to see if there are any security flaws in it.<br>
    The boss has HUGE plans and we‚Äôve gotta make sure we are running a tight ship here at Frost Tower.<br>
    <b>Hint:</b><br>
    The objective states ‚ÄúSubmit the string in the server data. response element‚Äù

We open Burp Suite and capture traffic for only slots.jackfrosttower.com. <br>
Click "Spin" in the bottom right corner. <br>
<img src="images/hhc2021/image042.png" alt="drawing" width="400px"/>

Burp intercepts the requests and shows a POST request to the /api/v1/<guid>/spin with three parameters: <br> 
<ol>
    <li>betamount</li>
    <li>numline</li>
    <li>cpl</li>
</ol>
<img src="images/hhc2021/image043.png" alt="drawing" width="600px"/>

We investigate with repeater, sending 1001 to the betamount parameter and It does not work. <br>
<img src="images/hhc2021/image044_1.png" alt="drawing" width="1000px"/>

Keeping the betamount parameter as 1001 (because we need to bet with >1000 coins), we manipulate the other two parameters, numline and cpl, send them to the API to see if we are successful.

    <b> Hints from Morcel Nougat : </b> <br>
        Do you know anything about USB Rubber Duckies?
        I've been playing around with them a bit myself.<br>
        Please see what you can do to help solve the Rubber Ducky Objective!<br>

We open the terminal and presented with a question <br>
Question: What is the troll username involved with this attack. <br>
<img src="images/hhc2021/image057.png" alt="drawing" width="600px"/>

We see there is an inject.bin under /mnt/USBDEVICE <br>
<img src="images/hhc2021/image058.png" alt="drawing" width="600px"/>

We do the file listing and we see a python file named ‚Äúmallard.py‚Äù. <br>
If we look at the contents of the file, we see the python script takes an "inject.bin" file as an input
<img src="images/hhc2021/image059.png" alt="drawing" width="600px"/>
<img src="images/hhc2021/image060.png" alt="drawing" width="800px"/>

We run the mallard.py with the inject.bin as input.
```python
python ./mallard.py --file /mnt/USBDEVICE/inject.bin
```
The rubber ducky binary inject.bin is decoded.
We see a few interesting things being done in the original file. Numbered in the screenshot below :

<ol>
<li>There is a hardcoded base 64 string which looks like reversed ("==" in the front)</li>
<li>The "rev" used to reverse the already reversed base64 string making it a proper base64 string.</li>
<li>"base64" command with -d switch to decode the base64 string </li>
</ol>

<img src="images/hhc2021/image061.png" alt="drawing" width="1000px"/>

So we take the above line from the source code  and execute in the terminal <br>
The base64 is reversed and decoded to reveal the user‚Äôs name.

<img src="images/hhc2021/image062.png" alt="drawing" width="1000px"/>

In the above an authorized_key file is getting created with the public cert for the user <b>ickymcgoop</b>.
 The answer is <b>ickymcgoop</b> <br>

We submit that username as the answer. 
<img src="images/hhc2021/image063.png" alt="drawing" width="1000px"/>

The answer gets accepted and we complete this objective.
