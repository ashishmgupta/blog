| Objective completed      | The story |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| <img src="images/hhc2021/image002.png" alt="drawing" width="500px"/>     | Listen children to a story that was written in the cold<br> 'Bout a ringle and his castle hosting hackers, meek and bold<br> Then from somewhere came another, built his tower tall and proud<br> Surely, he, our Frosty villain hides intentions 'neath a shroud<br> So begins Jack's reckless mission: gather trolls to win a war<br> Build a con that's fresh and shiny, has his yet been done before?<br> Is his Fest more feint than folly? Some have noticed subtle clues<br> Running 'round and raiding repos, stealing Santa's Don'ts and Do's<br> Misdirected, scheming, grasping, Frost intends to seize the day<br> Funding research with a gift shop, can Frost build the better sleigh? <br>Lo, we find unlikely allies: trolls within Jack's own command<br> Doubting Frost and searching motive, questioning his dark demand<br> Is our Jack just lost and rotten - one more outlaw stomping toes?<br> Why then must we piece together cludgy, wacky radios?<br> With this object from the heavens, Frost must know his cover's blown<br> Hearkening from distant planet! We the heroes should have known<br> Go ahead and hack your neighbor, go ahead and phish a friend<br> Do it in the name of holidays, you can justify it at year's end<br> There won't be any retweets praising you, come disclosure day<br> But on the snowy evening after? Still Kris Kringle rides the sleigh |
