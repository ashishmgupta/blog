<p class="MyNormalStyle">
Thank you Counter Hack Team for delivering another fantastic Kringlecon.<br>
The storyline, the world created, and the challenges were awesome. 
I learnt a lot and cannot wait for the next year! <br>
Lastly â€“ My 8-year-old waits for December every year since 2020.<br>
He found all the coins this year including the one below the bench in the Tolkien ring. <br>
He thanks you all as well!
